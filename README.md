# Vault Plugin: Google Cloud Platform Auth Backend

This is a standalone backend plugin for use with [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.github.com/hashicorp/vault).
This plugin allows for various GCP entities to authenticate with Vault.
This is currently included in Vault distributions.

Currently, this plugin supports login for:

- IAM service accounts
- GCE Instances

**Please note**: We take Vault's security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Vault, _please responsibly disclose_ by contacting us at [security@hashicorp.com](mailto:security@hashicorp.com).

## Getting Started

This is a [Vault plugin](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/plugins)
and is meant to work with Vault. This guide assumes you have already installed Vault
and have a basic understanding of how Vault works.

Otherwise, first read this guide on how to [get started with Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install).

To learn specifically about how plugins work, see documentation on [Vault plugins](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/plugins).

### Usage

Please see [documentation for the plugin](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/gcp)
on the Vault website.

This plugin is currently built into Vault and by default is accessed
at `auth/gcp`. To enable this in a running Vault server:

```sh
$ vault auth enable gcp
Success! Enabled gcp auth method at: gcp/
```

To see all the supported paths, see the [GCP auth API docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/gcp).

## Developing

Please note that local development is only required if you plan to contribute or
compile this plugin yourself. This plugin is automatically bundled in Vault
installations and is available by default. You do not need to compile it
yourself unless you intend to modify it.

If you wish to work on this plugin, you'll first need
[Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.10+ is
*required*).

For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including
setting up a [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
Next, clone this repository into your `GOPATH`:

### Build Plugin

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp
   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-gcp $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/
   $ cd vault-plugin-auth-gcp
   ```

1. You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your
environment:

   ```sh
   $ make bootstrap
   ```

1. To compile a development version of this plugin, run `make` or `make dev`.
This will put the plugin binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders. `dev`
mode will only generate the binary for your platform and is faster:

   ```sh
   $ make
   $ make dev
   ```

### Start Vault

1. For local development, use Vault's "dev" mode for fast setup:

   ```sh
   $ vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=root -dev-plugin-dir="$GOPATH/vault-plugins"
   ```

### Set Up Plugin in Vault

Next you want Vault to use the newly built binary instead of the version bundled with Vault.
You can use the scripted or manual methods depending on your preference.

Scripted method.

1. A Terraform project sets up the necessary gcp service account & credentials.
   You can configure the project id via this environment variable: `TF_VAR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`
   or paste it in the terminal when prompted.

    ```sh
    $ make setup-env
    ```

2. Source the environment variables generated by the setup project:

    ```sh
    $ source ./bootstrap/terraform/local_environment_setup.sh
    ```

3. Enable the dev version of the plugin on your local Vault instance. You can specify the plugin name,
   development [plugin directory](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration#plugin_directory)
   and mount path or leave empty to use the default values.

    ```sh
    $ make configure PLUGIN_NAME=vault-plugin-auth-gcp PLUGIN_DIR=$GOPATH/vault-plugins PLUGIN_PATH=gcp
    ```

Manual method.

1. Save the name of your project as an environment variable for reference:

    ```sh
    $ export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=my-project # replace with your project ID
    ```
The remaining steps may also be executed by running `. scripts/cred_setup.sh`.

1. Enable the IAM service on the project:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud services enable --project "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
        cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
        iam.googleapis.com
    ```

1. Create the service account:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud iam service-accounts create vault-tester \
        --display-name vault-tester \
        --project "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}"
    ```

1. Grant `project.viewer` and `serviceaccount.admin` permissions:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
        --member "serviceAccount:vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role "roles/viewer"

    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
        --member "serviceAccount:vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"

    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
        --member "serviceAccount:vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
    ```

1. Download the service account key file to local disk:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create vault-tester.json \
        --iam-account "vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

1. Export the credentials to an environment variable:

    ```sh
    $ export GOOGLE_TEST_CREDENTIALS="$(cat vault-tester.json)"
    ```

#### Tests

This plugin has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of this auth backend.

If you are developing this plugin and want to verify it is still
functioning (and you haven't broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.

Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*,
which may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug,
it is technically possible that broken backends could leave dangling
data behind. Therefore, please run the acceptance tests at your own risk.
At the very least, we recommend running them in their own private
account for whatever backend you're testing.

To run the acceptance tests, you will need a GCP IAM service account with the
appropriate permissions. You can use the steps explained in the [setup section](#set-up-plugin-in-vault) to configure one for you.

1. Save the name of your test project as an environment variable for reference:

    ```sh
    $ export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=my-project # replace with your project ID
    ```

1. Run the acceptance tests:

    ```sh
    $ make testacc
    ```

Note that it may take some time (e.g. over a minute) for the new credentials to work.

## Updating the Changelog

All pull requests that introduce a user-facing change must include a changelog
entry. We use the [changie](https://changie.dev/) tool to manage these entries
and automate the release process.

---
### 1. Installing Changie

You only need to do this once. If you don't have `changie` installed, choose one of the options below.

* **Homebrew** (macOS):
    ```shell
    brew install changie
    ```
* **Go Install**:
    ```shell
    go install github.com/miniscruff/changie@latest
    ```
* **Other Methods**:
  See the [official changie installation guide](https://changie.dev/guide/installation/) for other options, including pre-compiled binaries.

---
### 2. Creating an Entry

Once your code changes are complete, create the changelog entry:

1.  **Run the command** in your terminal:
    ```shell
    changie new
    ```
2.  **Follow the prompts.** An interactive prompt will ask you to select the
    kind of change (e.g., `BREAKING CHANGES`, `NOTES`, `FEATURES`) and write a concise description of
    what you changed.

3.  **Commit the new file.** After you're done, `changie` will create a new
    YAML file in the `.changie/unreleased` directory. Commit this file along with your other
    code changes before submitting your pull request.
